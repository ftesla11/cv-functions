All the implemented functions are found in utilities.py

To run the code for displaying the appropriate outputs corresponding to the assignmnent questions, use the jupyter notebook main.ipynb. Run the cells in order.

The first cell imports the functions from utilities.py. From then on, any ICV_function() can simply be called in the notebook


# Dataset
The code uses the provided dataset. To use the dataset, make sure a folder 'Dataset' is located in the same directory as the jupyter notebook.


# Figures
The folder figures holds all the diagrams that are displayed when running the jupyter notebook. The subfolders inside figures are split into the topics according to the corresponding question, such as transformations and convolutions for question 1 and 2 respectively.
